### Funding Market

Funding Market is an Ethereum-based governance protocol for public goods funding powered by prediction markets, reputation-weighted evaluation, and a two-house DAO structure.

The system combines:

- Prediction markets (continuous, 0–100 scale) → capture market sentiment about project impact
- Evaluator House → reputation-weighted human scoring via Soulbound Tokens (SBTs)
- Token House → manages treasury and round configuration
- Impact scoring engine → blends 20% market signal + 80% evaluator reputation signal
- Automated treasury payouts → projects receive ETH proportional to final impact score

Evaluators are onboarded, removed, and reputation-adjusted through on-chain governance. Each round’s surplus rolls forward automatically. The design creates an incentive-aligned, sybil-resistant mechanism for fair and transparent public goods funding.
